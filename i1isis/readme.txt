The charts "scanner3pg1cg.tif,scanner3pg2cg.tif,scanner3pg3cg.tif" should be printed Profile on US letter. The CGATs file "scanner3pgcg_M2.txt" (Which is the complete i1iSis scanned M2 CGATs file from my prints) can be loaded into i1Profiler. The charts should be set for an i1isis generating 33 rows, 29 columns for 957 patches each in landscape format. The printed charts can then be measured with an i1iSis and saved as a CGATS file. This file must include RGB and LAB values. This is then used as an input measurement file for scanner_refl_fix.
