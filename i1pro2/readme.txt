The chart "Chart 522 Patches.tif" should be printed landscape on US letter. The CGATs file "Chart 522 Patches.txt" is the CGATs RGB file that can be loaded into i1Profiler. The charts should be set for an I1 Pro2 generating 18 rows, 29 columns in landscape format. The printed chart can then be measured with the I1 Pro2 and saved as a CGATS file. This file must include RGB and LAB values. This is then used as an input measurement file for scanner_refl_fix.

When desktop scanning this file place the chart face down on the scanner with the title on the right side. It's important that when the scan'ed tiff file is viewed the title in on the left.  The "-ML" option reads the chart patches and orders them from the bottom to the top and left to right. This corresponds with the CGATs file sequences.
